# SlothDisco

**Start Your Journey into Python Development (Windows Edition)**  

This project is a beginner-friendly guide that walks you through setting up a complete Python development environment on Windows ‚Äî no shortcuts, no confusion, and no ‚Äúgotchas.‚Äù

## Why SlothDisco?
Because learning Python doesn‚Äôt have to be fast, boring, or painful.  
We take it **slow, simple, and step-by-step** ‚Äî and we make sure the dance floor (your development environment) is ready before the coding music starts.

The steps are broken into three parts so you can take it one application at a time:  

1. [GitHub Setup](github.md)  
   - Create your account  
   - Install Git  
   - Configure SSH keys on Windows  
   - Connect your computer securely to GitHub  
   - **Here‚Äôs why this is important:** GitHub is your central hub. It keeps your code safe, tracks every change you make, and makes it easy to share or ask for help.  

2. [Python Setup](python.md)  
   - Install the latest version of Python (3.13.x)  
   - Add Python to your PATH  
   - Verify the installation  
   - Upgrade pip (the Python package manager)  
   - **Here‚Äôs why this is important:** Python is the language we‚Äôll use. Installing it means your computer understands the code you write and can actually run it.  

3. [PyCharm Setup](pycharm.md)  
   - Download and install **PyCharm Community Edition** (the free version)  
   - Avoid getting tricked into the paid ‚ÄúProfessional‚Äù edition  
   - Configure your first launch for Python development  
   - **Here‚Äôs why this is important:** PyCharm is your workshop. It gives you tools to write, run, and debug your code without fighting the computer.  

4. [First Project Example](example.md)  
   - Create a new GitHub repository called **pycraft**  
   - Clone the repository to your computer  
   - Open the project in PyCharm  
   - Add and run your first Python file (`hello.py`)  
   - Commit and push your code back to GitHub  
   - **Here‚Äôs why this is important:** This ties everything together. You‚Äôll practice the full workflow: GitHub ‚Üí PyCharm ‚Üí Python code ‚Üí back to GitHub.

üöÄ Once you finish these four steps, you‚Äôll have a working setup, a real project in GitHub, and the confidence to move forward with Python.
