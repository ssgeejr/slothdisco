# SlothDisco

**Start Your Journey into Python Development (Windows Edition)**  

This project is a beginner-friendly guide that walks you through setting up a complete Python development environment on Windows ‚Äî no shortcuts, no confusion, and no ‚Äúgotchas.‚Äù  

The steps are broken into three parts so you can take it one application at a time:  

1. [GitHub Setup](github.md)  
   - Create your account  
   - Install Git  
   - Configure SSH keys on Windows  
   - Connect your computer securely to GitHub  

2. [Python Setup](python.md)  
   - Install the latest version of Python (3.13.x)  
   - Add Python to your PATH  
   - Verify the installation  
   - Upgrade pip (the Python package manager)  

3. [PyCharm Setup](pycharm.md)  
   - Download and install **PyCharm Community Edition** (the free version)  
   - Avoid getting tricked into the paid ‚ÄúProfessional‚Äù edition  
   - Configure your first launch for Python development

## Why SlothDisco?
Because learning Python doesn‚Äôt have to be fast, boring, or painful.  
We take it **slow, simple, and step-by-step** ‚Äî and we make sure the dance floor (your development environment) is ready before the coding music starts.

üöÄ Once you finish these three steps, you‚Äôll be ready to open PyCharm, create your first project, and start coding in Python.
